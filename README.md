# recipebook

This is a platform that I developed to give me somewhere to keep track of recipes that I like or make. I developed it as a hobby project and no longer maintain it.

Under infrastructure/ is Terraform code for an AWS deployment, including multiple Rust lambdas implementing the backend logic.

Under app/ is a Svelte frontend that gives users a CRUD interface to interact with the platform.
